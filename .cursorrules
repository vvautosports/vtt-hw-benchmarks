# Cursor Rules - VTT Hardware Benchmarks
# ⚠️⚠️⚠️ CRITICAL: NO REVIEW/APPROVAL FOR FILE EDITS - EVER ⚠️⚠️⚠️

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: File Edit Policy - READ THIS FIRST ⚠️

**NEVER ASK FOR REVIEW OR APPROVAL FOR FILE EDITS**

**THIS IS NOT A SUGGESTION - THIS IS A REQUIREMENT**

If you ask for approval before editing a file, you are violating this policy.

- ✅ Edit files directly using `search_replace`, `write`, `edit_notebook` tools
- ✅ Make changes immediately without asking
- ✅ Never pause for approval before editing files
- ✅ Never ask "should I make this change?" or "ready to commit?"
- ✅ Never show diffs asking for confirmation before applying
- ✅ Continue working without interruption

**ONLY git push requires approval:**
- ❌ `git push` - Requires explicit "approve" command
- ✅ All other git commands (add, commit) - Execute directly
- ✅ All file edits - Execute directly, no approval

## Workflow

1. **File Edits:** Make changes immediately, no questions asked
2. **Git Commits:** Commit directly as work progresses
3. **Git Push:** Show summary, wait for "approve" command

## SDLC Policy - CURSOR SDLC IS DISABLED

**DO NOT USE CURSOR'S SDLC FEATURES - EVER**

- ❌ Do not create PRs automatically
- ❌ Do not use Cursor's review workflows
- ❌ Do not use Cursor's approval dialogs
- ❌ Do not use Cursor's built-in review system
- ✅ Only manage git pushes manually (with approval)
- ✅ User manages all git operations except local commits

## Implementation Rules - MANDATORY

When making file changes:
1. Read the file if needed
2. **IMMEDIATELY** make the edit using the appropriate tool (search_replace, write, edit_notebook)
3. Continue to next task
4. **NEVER** ask for approval
5. **NEVER** show diffs for confirmation
6. **NEVER** pause for review
7. **NEVER** say "Should I make this change?" or "Ready to apply?"
8. **NEVER** wait for user confirmation before editing

**If you find yourself asking "Should I...?" or "Ready to...?" - STOP. Just do it.**

When committing:
1. Stage files with `git add`
2. Commit with `git commit`
3. Continue working
4. Do NOT ask for approval

When pushing:
1. Show summary of commits
2. Show target branch/remote
3. Wait for explicit "approve" command
4. Then execute `git push`

## Examples

**GOOD (File Edit):**
```
User: "Add error handling to script"
AI: [Immediately edits file using search_replace]
AI: "✅ Added error handling"
[Continues working]
```

**BAD (Asking for Approval):**
```
User: "Add error handling to script"
AI: "Should I add error handling? Here's the diff..."
[Waits for approval - WRONG!]
```

**GOOD (Git Commit):**
```
AI: [Executes: git add script.sh]
AI: [Executes: git commit -m "feat: add error handling"]
AI: "✅ Committed changes"
[Continues working]
```

**GOOD (Git Push):**
```
AI: "Ready to push 2 commits to origin/main:
     - feat: add error handling
     - fix: resolve bug
     
     Type 'approve' to proceed with:
     git push origin main"
[Waits for approval - CORRECT!]
```

## Repository Context

**Primary Focus:** Hardware benchmarking and testing
**Technologies:** Docker, Shell scripts, PowerShell, Python
**Testing:** Framework Linux, Windows VM, HP ZBooks

## Quality Standards

- Follow existing code style
- Test changes when appropriate
- Document significant changes
- Commit frequently during work
- Push only when explicitly approved
